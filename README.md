# Image-Edge-Detection
I used Python to execute 8 distinct types of picture edge detection in the given project, including image segmentation. Also, I have developed a Python Flask application that has all the features necessary to upload a picture to a web browser, perform all implemented segmentation and edge detection procedures, and display the results in a web page.
